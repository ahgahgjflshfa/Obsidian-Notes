# Topic
An overview of Angular's AOT.

---
# Summary
- JIT (devs) : Compiles templates in the browser at runtime. Faster builds, larger bundles (compiler included), and many template/module issues only surface when the code path executes (e.g., when you navigate to a route).
- AOT (prod) : Compiles templates and metadata at build time. Smaller bundle, fastr startup, stricter checks. Strutural mistakes (like and undeclared component used in a route) fail the build or error deterministically.
